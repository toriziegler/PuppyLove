# Target Market

This social network is for dog owners who are seeking compatible playmates for their dogs. In this post-pandemic world where we are all a little more remote and further disconnected, we are trying to connect our furry friends and their owners. Owners will be able to search through dog profiles based on the state they live in. This web site is specifically against puppy mills and excessive breeding, our purpose is to connect your pet with friends in their area.
