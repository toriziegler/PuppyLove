What we today?
- Met with team
- Did our morning Scrum meeting 
- I found the bugs in the Views and now all the methods are functioning 
- We worked as a group to fix up our yaml file and our docker dev file, because our initial attempt was wrong. Thanks to the help of our instructors we were able to fix it and now our main blocker is done.

 Potential blockers?
1. We have been putting off all our merges since we have been working on different things. We decided to just start making our own working branches and will piece the project together later on.

What we today?
- Met with team
- I worked with Stephen a little on the front end React for the login pages.
- I tried to finish up the Owner views, how ever we all seem to be running into issues

 Potential blockers?
1. The over views are mostly functional, but for some reason the PUT method is not updating the data despite giving a 200 code. Also I can no longer create an owner from insomnia.
2. They teams seems be hitting a wall, but everyone is in good spirits. I like these guys.

-I added the rest of the request methods for the dog Views. Our next goal is to get all 50 states and their abbreviations to the data base so we don't have to manually enter the states every time we create an owner.

 Potential blockers?
1. Strange bug was found at the end of the day were we have to comment of certain part of the setting to get the browser to function, but also it seems to be affecting the admin page for our site in the browser.
