Today I worked on:
    We are experiencing a bug with our Django admin page, it is not loading the correct css and appears to just be showing with HTML format. We had a bug in our settings.py file that ended up being a missing comma between the last two items. We decided we need to alter our code to have an Accounts microservice and remove the Owner model from puppy love rest. We will then link the users to dogs that way we can use authentication services. I worked on getting a states dropdown list working with the data.json file json dictionary of states and their abbreviations. I also worked on implementing CI/CD in our docker-compose file.

Today I worked on:
    Creating GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE views with Nicolas and Norton. We were able to get it fully functioning for Dogs, and will need to work on Owners and States tomorrow. We had issues with CSRF verification with POST methods and placed the decorator for csrf_exempt so we could get our views functioning normally. We tried adding CSRF Allowed Origins, altering the allowed hosts, and adding the CSRF Cookies into settings.py, however none of these options removed the error hence the decorator. I tried to create a data.json file with all of the states and their abbreviations with preset id's so it is easier to call to later in our project and constant for anyone using the code, it is not fully functioning at the moment because I need to figure out how to tie it in with our actual models but it is on its way.

Today I worked on:
    The team collaborated on creating our models to reinforce ubiquitous language throughout the project once we move on to paired or solo programming. While working on models we ran into an unknown territory - image file uploads for our website users. Through lots of research through docs, stackoverflow, and youtube videos we were able to determine we needed to install Pillow and use ImageField in our Django model. At the present time we have coded for the ability to upload an image as a user that is stored in the database under the path name to where it is stored in a media directory. This strategy for image storage is not practical in the real world sense if our website was to become widely popular. It would need to be updated to store images to the cloud to free up space within our program, however at this point in time the directory within our code actually saves money not having to pay for cloud space. One other problem we ran into was creating the phone number field in Django, for now we have it set as a TextField but in the future we would like to implement a specific format for user input so all phone numbers appear the same in the database.

Today I worked on:
    The team collaborated on setting up our MVP and stretch goals. For now our MVP includes a profile page for dogs to include their information and a search page to show the profiles of other dogs within the user's dog's state. We updated our Excalidraw group notes and discussed ubiquitous language for our project and the microservices we will implement.  We created our docker-compose file.
