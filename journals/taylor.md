Today, I worked on:

* Building the docker-compose.yaml file

The team all worked together to build out the docker-compose
file. We ran into many questions and errors along the way

#Create-User postgres-data# - for the postgres database. 
 ERROR: syntax error at or near -
 we were able to rename this to "postgresdata" without the - and it worked that way. We were not following naming conventions.
