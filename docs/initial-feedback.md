## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
People love pets, so this market is very real and sizable. I like the idea of helping to get pets adopted!

### Scope of work
I love to see that you have the MVP and stretch-goals divided out. However, I think your MVP is a little skinny at this point. Is there a feature or two from your StretchGoals list that you could comfortably bring into the MVP?

### Integrations
All of the integrations you listed are interesting, but which ones are you actually going to use?

### Docs
The start on your docs looks good. For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
