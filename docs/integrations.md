- **Google Geolocation API**
Google’s Geolocation API automatically populates a user’s location based on nearby cell towers and WiFi nodes. The API’s communication is done over HTTPS and POST. Google’s API is capable of extremely accurate locating, but it’s a good idea for dating app developers to obscure a user’s exact location for privacy and security reasons.


- **Instagram Basic Display API**
Help users import photos, videos, and information from their Instagram accounts into their dating app profile using Instagram’s Basic Display API. This HTTP-based API is ideal for dating apps, because it gives singles a sneak peek into a user's life outside of dating. Note: This API is not intended to help users login to a dating app using their Instagram username/password. To authenticate users for login, use Facebook Login.
