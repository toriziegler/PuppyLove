# Integrations
     
Google Cloud Vision API
Google’s Vision REST and RPC APIs offer pre-trained machine learning models to help developers understand the content of their app’s images. The powerful API can detect faces, objects and animals, dominant colors, text in more than 50 languages, and more.

Google Geolocation API
Google’s Geolocation API automatically populates a user’s location based on nearby cell towers and WiFi nodes. The API’s communication is done over HTTPS and POST. Google’s API is capable of extremely accurate locating, but it’s a good idea for dating app developers to obscure a user’s exact location for privacy and security reasons.

Instagram Basic Display API
Help users import photos, videos, and information from their Instagram accounts into their dating app profile using Instagram’s Basic Display API. This HTTP-based API is ideal for dating apps, because it gives singles a sneak peek into a user's life outside of dating. Note: This API is not intended to help users login to a dating app using their Instagram username/password. To authenticate users for login, use Facebook Login.
